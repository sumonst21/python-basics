- [x] All of the above.

## The Python Interface
Example code added on script.py

## Any comments?
To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result.

## Python as a calculator
Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

- Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
- Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.

The code in the script on the right gives some examples.
 Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100×1.1=110 dollars, and after two years it's 100×1.1×1.1=121. Add code on the right to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years.
